## Group project requirements
1. Generation of random game sets or events: the player will roll a dice at the beginning of a game, and the dice result will simulate the senario of this game. 
2. Data structures and dynamic memory management: A string vector is utilised for the player to store notes during the game
3. File input/output: one I/O file is used to record playered senarios to avoid repetition
4. Program codes in multiple files: our program is comprised of five files
5. Proper indentation and naming styles: we have consistent naming style and correct indentation
5. In-code documentation: codes are annotated
